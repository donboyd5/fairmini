# Equations

## Model summary

There are three consumption equations, three investment equations, a demand for imports equation, a price equation, the Fed’s interest rate rule, and a term structure equation explaining the mortgage rate. The equations are estimated by two-stage least squares (2SLS) with account taken, when necessary, of serial correlation of the residuals. The estimation period is 1954:1–2014:4 except for the Fed rule, where the period ends in 2008:3. (p.3)

## Data notes

FMFP.ZIP\sonyc\fm has:

-   fmdata.txt – ALL of the other endogenous input variables
-   fmexog.txt – exogenous values
-   fminput.txt – has the FULL FairModel with 30 equations (US MODEL JANUARY 31, 2025 SPACE MAXVAR=500 MAXS=30 MAXCOEF=30 MAXFSR=60 FIRSTPER=1952.1 LASTPER=2027.4;)
-   fmout.txt – output from estimation and solution of the model

## Variables

Nominal variables are denoted with a \$ at the end. The stock variables are summed from flows, where the base-quarter value is given in the table. The summation when relevant is both forward and backward. The variables constructed from peak-to-peak interpolations are on straight lines between the peaks. The capital gain or loss variable, CG\$, is constructed from Flowof Funds data. Likewise, the construction of PHOUSE, the price of housing relative to the GDP deflator, uses Flow of Funds data.
