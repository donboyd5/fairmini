# Model summary

There are three consumption equations, three investment equations, a demand for imports equation, a price equation, the Fed’s interest rate rule, and a term structure equation explaining the mortgage rate. The equations are estimated by two-stage least squares (2SLS) with account taken, when necessary, of serial correlation of the residuals. The estimation period is 1954:1–2014:4 except for the Fed rule, where the period ends in 2008:3. (p.3)

Much of the text below is drawn from Fair 2015a, not always with quotes.

## Data notes

-   fmdata.txt – ALL of the other endogenous input variables
-   fmexog.txt – exogenous values
-   fminput.txt – has the FULL FairModel with 30 equations (US MODEL JANUARY 31, 2025 SPACE MAXVAR=500 MAXS=30 MAXCOEF=30 MAXFSR=60 FIRSTPER=1952.1 LASTPER=2027.4;)
-   fmout.txt – output from estimation and solution of the model

## Variables

Nominal variables are denoted with a \$ at the end. The stock variables are summed from flows, where the base-quarter value is given in the table. The summation when relevant is both forward and backward. The variables constructed from peak-to-peak interpolations are on straight lines between the peaks. The capital gain or loss variable, CG\$, is constructed from Flowof Funds data. Likewise, the construction of PHOUSE, the price of housing relative to the GDP deflator, uses Flow of Funds data.

## Time-varying constants

From his mini-model (pp.):

> An attempt is made in some equations to try to pick up a time varying relationship. It is hard with macro data to do much, but some significant estimates of a time varying constant term have been picked up. The assumption made, for a sample from 1 through T, is that the constant term is the same up to some observation T1, then changes linearly up to some observation T2, and is then unchanged at the T2 value through T. The estimate of C2 in the tables for an equation is the estimate of the slope. The estimate of C is the estimate of the constant term up to T1. If the estimate of C2 is significant, this is evidence in favor of time variation of the constant term. After some experimentation, **T1 was taken to be 1969:4 for all the equations and T2 was taken to be 1988:4**. For more discussion see MM (Section 2.3.2).

From MM:

> The above discussion of single equation estimation does not consider the case of time varying coefficients. It is hard to deal with this case when using macro data because the variation in the data is generally not large enough to allow more than a few coefficients to be estimated per equation with any precision. Postulating time varying coefficients introduces more coefficients to estimate per equation, which can be a problem. A method is proposed in this subsection for dealing with one type of time varying coefficients that may be common in macro equations. The method is used in Section 3.6 for some of the U.S. equations in the MC model.

> A common assumption in the time varying literature is that coefficients follow random walks—see, for example, Stock and Watson (1998). This assumption is problematic in macro work since it does not seem likely that macroeconomic relationships change via randomwalk coefficients or similar assumptions. It seems more likely that they change in slower, perhaps trend like, ways. Also, it seems unlikely that changes take place over the entire sample period. If there is a change, it may begin after the beginning of the sample period and end before the end of the sample period. The assumption used here postulates no change for a while, then smooth trend change for a while, and then no change after that. The assumption can be applied to any number of coefficients in an equation, although it is probably not practical with macro data to deal with more than one or two coefficients per equation.

IOW: constant term is same up to 1969:4 (T1), then changes linearly up to some 1988:4 (T2) and unchanged through T

## Constructing CDA

CDA is a scale variable that is exogenous in the model. It is constructed from a peak-to-peak interpolation of CD_pop (i.e., CD / POP). (2015a p.20) Used only in equation 3.

Based on the plot, the peaks Fair uses don't seem quite appropriate for current (revised) data – some are off – but for now I use them.

## Instrumental variables

Most if not all of the model's equations are estimated using 2SLS. This requires choosing instrumental variables.

Using Equation 2 as an example, the LHS variable is log(CN/POP). The RHS variables are C, C2, AG1, AG2, AG3, log(CN/POP) lagged once, change in log(CN/POP) lagged once, log(AA/POP) lagged once, log(YD/POP) (not lagged), and RS. In 2SLS, current consumption (log(CN/POP)) and current disposable income (log(YD/POP)) are treated as jointly (endogenously) determined, while the other regressors are either explicitly exogenous or “predetermined” (lagged) variables. In a standard 2SLS/IV setting, you use all of the truly exogenous variables (and any valid lagged endogenous variables) from the system as instruments for the endogenous right‐hand‐side variable(s).

-   **Endogenous vs. Exogenous**

    -   **Endogenous (needs instruments)**

        -   log(CN/POP) on the left‐hand side, and also its current value on the right if it appears (though typically consumption appears on the LHS only; if the equation is in differences or has current vs. lagged logs on the RHS, then the current log of consumption is a function of the error term).

        -   log(YD/POP) (disposable income) is determined simultaneously in the larger system (it appears in the income and/or tax/transfer equations).

    -   **Exogenous or Predetermined (valid as instruments)**

        -   The **time trend polynomials** C, C2 are exogenous.

        -   The **age‐distribution variables** AG1, AG2, AG3 are demographic measures taken as exogenous.

        -   **Interest rate (RS)** is typically exogenous in this mini model (treated as policy‐determined).

        -   **Lagged values** of any endogenous variables (e.g. lag of log(CN/POP), lag of Δlog(CN/POP), lag of log(AA/POP)) are assumed predetermined in Fair’s framework, so they can serve as valid instruments.

-   **Putting That into AER::ivreg**

    -   On the left‐hand side of the equation, you have log(CN/POP).

    -   On the right‐hand side, you suspect that log(YD/POP) is endogenous (and possibly the contemporaneous log(CN/POP) if it entered the equation).

    -   Consequently, all of the exogenous/predetermined variables—namely C, C2, AG1, AG2, AG3, RS, and the lagged endogenous terms—go into the instrument list.

    -   In short, **the instruments are all of the exogenous and lagged variables** (i.e., C, C2, AG1, AG2, AG3, RS, and the lagged log terms)

C + C2 + AG1 + AG2 + AG3 + RS + lagged log(CN/POP) + Δlagged log(CN/POP) + lagged log(AA/POP)

Here is a table of first-stage regressors from the appendix of the documentation:
